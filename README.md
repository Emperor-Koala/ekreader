# EKReader

## Introduction

EKReader is a cross-platform e-reader that allows you to connect to your Komga instance and download your books for offline reading. 

The interface was designed to mimic the original Komga web interface in order to provide a simple and clean experience. 

EKReader was written with React Native to enable proper cross-platform support, so that anyone can connect to their library from any device and continue to use the same familiar interface.

TODO: Add play store and app store logos
